SNORTBAN

Parses the snort alert log and creates one line logs suitable for fail2ban.

REQUIRES

    - Perl
    - One Perl module: Proc::PID::File.
      On Debian, Ubuntu and derivates install it issuing:
        # apt-get install libproc-pid-file-perl
    - fail2ban
    - snort

HOW TO INSTALL

    - Copy the snortban file to a place suitable, run it from /etc/rc.loca
      or create a service file.  It must be called with an '&' so it goes to background.

    - Add an entry in your logrotate.d/snort file to rotate your alert.ban file.
      

USAGE

    snortban [--debug] [--logfile=/var/log/snort/alert] [--banfile=/var/log/snort/alert.ban] &

USING FROM fail2ban

    When running, snortban will log entries to the banfile like this:

    Thu Jan 12 09:56:07 2012 [Priority: 3]  1.2.3.4 -> 5.6.7.8 [**] [122:3:0] (portscan) TCP Portsweep [**]

    Filters must be created in fail2ban to check it. Two examples are in this
    package: snortp1.conf and snortp2.conf. Those fails should be in 
    /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/
    Add this to your jail.conf file so the rules are used:

[snortp1]
enabled  = true
port     = 22
banaction= iptables-allports
filter   = snort_p1
maxretry = 1
logpath  = /var/log/snort/alert.ban

[snortp2]
enabled  = true
port     = 22
banaction= iptables-allports
filter   = snort_p2
maxretry = 10
logpath  = /var/log/snort/alert.ban
